Note to Professor:
I couldn’t get the location to work. It popped up towards the beginning and I clicked ‘allow’, but I never saw it again, and it doesn’t properly show the location. The ‘add image’ feature is a little weird too— you won’t see the image added on the addApartmentView, but it does save with the listing.
